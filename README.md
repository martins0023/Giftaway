## Understanding of Different Navigator used for the Login Signup
To see how we‚Äôve used the different navigators to arrange the above-mentioned screens. We made use of three navigators in this project:
**Stack Navigator was used to navigate between Auth Screens (Login and SignUp) and also for the internal navigation of Home or Setting screen
**Drawer Navigator was used to set up the Home Screen, About screen and Logout Screen.
